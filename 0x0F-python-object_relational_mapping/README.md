Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in creating a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases. Put another way, you can see the ORM as the layer that connects object oriented programming (OOP) to relational databases

One of the challenges of using object-oriented programming (OOP) languages and databases is the complexity of aligning the programming code with database structures. Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a technique that creates a layer between the language and the database, helping programmers work with data without the OOP paradigm.

The challenge OOP developers have is the need to understand and code in the structured query language (SQL) in order to connect their application to an SQL database. Developers who know SQL can write data-access code. This raw SQL coding can be extremely time-consuming because it requires the developer to extract the code stringsâ€™ data elements. SQL query builders add a layer of abstraction to the SQL code to provide more information about the data. However, developers still need to understand and write SQL
